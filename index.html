        <div class="about-text">
          <p>Hi! I'm Taina, and I'm a senior at IN-Tech Academy. I've been in Computer Science for all four years of high school, and I wouldn't have traded it for the world. I'm passionate about CS and technology, and my journey has been an exciting exploration filled with problem-solving and creativity.
          </p>
          
          <h3>My CS Journey</h3>
          <p>I chose Computer Science because I enjoy the challenge of problem-solving and the creativity that comes with coding. Over the course of high school, my view of CS has grown from seeing it as a difficult and intimidating subject to gaining a deeper understanding of code and learning how to overcome challenges with confidence.</p>
          
          <h3>Future Plans</h3>
          <p>After graduation, I plan to go to SUNY Purchase College to study Communications and Journalism. I'm excited to continue learning and growing in the field of technology.</p>
