## Dear Future CS Students... 💌

Hii, future coders! 

When I first started my CS journey, I had no idea what I was getting into. When I first started CS as a freshman, I thought it was going to be all math and super complicated code (Which was my worst nightmare) and yeah, sometimes it is. What I liked most about coding it’s also creative, rewarding, and even fun. You can bring things you imagine into your head and make it ten times better.


### What I Wish I Knew When I Started 🎯
 I wish that I had known that it's okay to get stuck and not know something. You’re not supposed to be a pro on day one. Research, and ChatGPT will be your best friend. So will trial and error. Just remember to be patient with yourself.

### The Most Surprising Thing About CS 😱

The most surprising thing was how creative CS can be!  When I created my Walking Dead game app, I realized that coding is just another way to tell stories and create experiences. Not to sound cheesy but, CS isn’t just about computers, it’s about how you think. You’ll learn to break problems into steps, spot patterns, and get creative when things go wrong

### The Mindset That Helped Me Succeed 💪

1. Stay curious

2. Don’t be afraid to fail, but  never give up

3. Don't be afraid to ask for help

4. Keep practicing even when it’s frustrating

## Favorite CS Memory: The Bridgerton Quiz Project 🎭

One of my proudest moments was creating the Walking dad game. It was the first time I really felt like a developer and created everything myself from scratch! It made me so happy to see what I envisioned come to life with all the experience I learned.

You’ve got this. CS can be tough, but it’s worth it. You’ll build things, break things, learn from it all — and maybe even have a laugh along the way.
